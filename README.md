## 🔍 Advanced Usage & Custom Tips

SHAKUNI is not just a simple wordlist generator — it's a **mind twister**. You can play creatively with your input fields. Here's how you can maximize its power:

### ✅ 1. Fields Are Flexible — Not Fixed
You are **not required** to enter full information. You can keep fields partial, creative, or even mix them:
- `dob = 2002` (just year)
- `dob = Dec` (just month)
- `color = dark` (not necessarily a color, can be any word)
- `nickname = thunderbolt`

### ✅ 2. Mix Real + Random Information
Combine real details with creative, fictional, or aggressive phrases:
- `name = raj`, `suffix = darkslayer`
- Output: `rajdark`, `darkraj`, `darkslayerraj`, etc.

### ✅ 3. Leave Fields Blank If Not Needed
You can skip any field. The tool works perfectly even if only one or two inputs are given. It auto-generates patterns from available data only.

### ✅ 4. Use Movie, Game, or Fictional Data
Nothing stops you from using fictional data:
- `name = ghost`, `pet = wolf`, `suffix = boom`
- Output: `ghostwolf`, `wolfboom`, `ghostboom`, `boomwolf`, etc.

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
> The more creative and unexpected your combinations, the better your wordlist becomes for password testing or OSINT analysis.
